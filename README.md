# Oled-Eyes-Keychain
# WiFi Robot Eyes 🤖👀

Cosmo-style animated robot eyes on a tiny OLED, controlled from your phone over WiFi — no app needed, just a browser. Built for the **ESP32-C3 Super Mini** and a **1.3" I2C OLED (SH1106, 128x64)**.

Tap a button on your phone to switch expressions: normal/idle, happy, surprised, angry, sleepy, wink, love, and look-left/right. Hold the board's built-in BOOT button to put it to sleep, tap it again to wake it back up — no extra hardware button needed.

## What you need

| Part | Notes |
|---|---|
| ESP32-C3 Super Mini | Any ESP32-C3 dev board works, pins may differ slightly |
|1,3" I2C OLED display | SH1106 driver, 128x64, 4-pin (GND/VCC/SCL/SDA) |
| USB-C cable | Data-capable, not charge-only |
| A phone or laptop | To connect to the board's WiFi and control it |

No extra buttons, resistors, or breadboard strictly required — the OLED wires directly to the board, and power on/off uses the button that's already built into the board.

---

## Wiring

| OLED pin | Connects to (ESP32-C3) |
|---|---|
| GND | GND |
| VCC | 3V3 *(not 5V — most of these OLEDs are 3.3V logic only)* |
| SCL | GPIO21 |
| SDA | GPIO20 |

```
OLED            ESP32-C3 Super Mini
----            -------------------
GND     ------->  GND
VCC     ------->  3V3
SCL     ------->  GPIO221
SDA     ------->  GPIO20
```

**Board-specific notes:**
- GPIO21 and GPIO20 are safe general-purpose pins on the C3 — no boot conflicts.
- Avoid using GPIO2, GPIO8, or GPIO9 for anything else you add later — these are strapping pins tied to the board's boot mode selection, and misusing them can cause boot loops.
- The onboard I2C address used in the code is `0x3C` (the standard for most SH1106 modules). If the screen stays blank, some clone boards use `0x3D` instead — see the troubleshooting section.

---

## Arduino IDE setup

1. Install the **ESP32 board package** if you haven't already: `File > Preferences > Additional Board Manager URLs`, add:
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`
   Then `Tools > Board > Boards Manager`, search "esp32", install the Espressif package.
2. Install libraries via `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries`:
   - **Adafruit GFX Library**
   - **Adafruit SSD1306**
   - (`WiFi.h` and `WebServer.h` come bundled with the ESP32 board package — nothing to install for those.)
3. Under `Tools > Board`, select your ESP32-C3 board (e.g. "ESP32C3 Dev Module" or the closest Super Mini match).
4. Under `Tools > Port`, select the port your board shows up as after plugging in via USB.

---

## Uploading the code

1. Copy the full sketch below into a new file named `robot_eyes_wifi.ino` (or download it from this repo).
2. Near the top, change the WiFi name/password if you like:
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid     = "RobotEyes";
   const char* password = "eyes1234";   // must be 8+ characters, or "" for an open network
   ```
3. Click **Upload**.
4. Open `Tools > Serial Monitor`, set the baud rate to **115200**. You should see:
   ```
   softAP() returned: true
   AP started. Connect phone to WiFi: RobotEyes
   Then open: http://192.168.4.1
   Hold BOOT button ~5s to sleep. Press BOOT again to wake.
   ```

If you see `softAP() returned: false`, or nothing shows up in your phone's WiFi list at all, jump to [Beginner mistakes & troubleshooting](#beginner-mistakes--troubleshooting) — this was the very first bug this project ran into.

---

## First run

1. On your phone, go to WiFi settings and connect to the **RobotEyes** network using the password you set.
2. Open a browser and go to: **http://192.168.4.1**
3. You should see a **"Pick a face"** page with buttons.

---

## Using it

Tap any button on the web page to change the expression:

- Normal / Idle — default animated blinking + occasional glance
- Happy
- Surprised
- Angry
- Sleepy
- Wink
- Love (hearts)
- Look Left / Look Right

Each tap sends a request to `/set?mode=...` on the board, which updates the animation shown on the OLED.

---

## Sleep / wake (power button)

There's no separate physical power switch — the board's **built-in BOOT button** doubles as one:

1. **Hold BOOT for about 5 second, then let go.** The OLED blanks and the WiFi network disappears from your phone's list — the board is now in light sleep, drawing much less power.
2. **Press BOOT again (a quick tap)** to wake it back up. The OLED lights back up on the *same face it was showing before*, and the WiFi network reappears within a few seconds.

Important detail if you're modifying this: the wake condition is level-triggered (checks "is the pin LOW right now"), so the code deliberately waits for you to **release** the long-press before it actually sleeps — otherwise it would see your finger still on the button and wake up instantly. This was a real bug during development; see the troubleshooting section.

## The full code

```cpp
/*

Cosmo-style animated robot eyes — WiFi controlled from your phone

ESP32-C3 Super Mini + 1.3" I2C OLED (SH1106, 128x64)

  

HOW IT WORKS:

- ESP32 creates its own WiFi network (Access Point mode)

- Connect your phone to that WiFi network

- Open a browser to 192.168.4.1

- Tap a button to switch the face/animation

- Hold the built-in BOOT button (GPIO9) for ~1 second to power down

(light sleep). Press BOOT again to wake it back up.

  

WIRING (unchanged from before):

OLED GND -> GND

OLED VCC -> 3V3

OLED SCL -> GPIO21

OLED SDA -> GPIO20

  

LIBRARIES NEEDED (Arduino IDE -> Library Manager):

- Adafruit GFX Library

- Adafruit SH110X

(WiFi.h and WebServer.h are built into the ESP32 board package already)

  

SETUP:

1. Change ssid/password below to whatever you want.

2. Upload.

3. On your phone, go to WiFi settings, connect to that network.

4. Open a browser, go to: http://192.168.4.1

5. Tap buttons to change expressions.

6. Hold BOOT (GPIO9) ~5s to sleep. Press it again to wake up.

  

FIX NOTES (AP not showing up in WiFi list):

Root cause was the radio browning out during AP beaconing at full TX power

on ESP32-C3 Super Mini boards. The fix is to explicitly drop TX power

right after WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP) and before WiFi.softAP(). This makes the

brownout-detector-disable hack unnecessary, so it's been removed.

  

POWER-OFF NOTES:

The ESP32 can't cut its own power from software, so "off" here means

light sleep: OLED is blanked and WiFi is shut down while sleeping.

GPIO9 (BOOT) isn't RTC-capable on the C3, so deep-sleep ext0/ext1 wakeup

can't use it — light sleep with a plain GPIO wakeup works on any pin

instead, and keeps RAM intact, so it resumes on the same face it was

showing rather than rebooting back to "normal".

## Beginner mistakes & troubleshooting

These are the actual issues hit while building this project, in the order they came up — if you're following along and something's not working, check here first.

### 1. WiFi network never shows up in the phone's WiFi list
**Symptom:** Code uploads fine, Serial Monitor might even look normal, but "RobotEyes" never appears when you scan for WiFi networks on your phone.
**Cause:** On ESP32-C3 Super Mini boards, running the radio at full TX power during AP beaconing can brown out the chip's power rail. It's a known issue on these specific boards, not a code bug in the usual sense.
**Fix:** Explicitly lower the TX power right after switching to AP mode and before starting the access point:
```cpp
WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP);
delay(100);
WiFi.setTxPower(WIFI_POWER_8_5dBm);   // the fix
bool apOk = WiFi.softAP(ssid, password);
```
Don't reach for disabling the brownout detector (`WRITE_PERI_REG(RTC_CNTL_BROWN_OUT_REG, 0)`) as a "fix" — that just hides the symptom instead of solving the actual power issue, and can mask other real problems.

### 2. Compile error: `'esp_sleep_enable_ext0_wakeup' was not declared in this scope`
**Cause:** `ext0`/`ext1` deep-sleep wakeup functions only work on **RTC-capable GPIOs**. On the ESP32-C3, only **GPIO0–GPIO5** are RTC-capable — GPIO9 (the BOOT button) is not one of them, so this function can't be used with it at all, on any core version.
**Fix:** Use **light sleep** instead of deep sleep, with a plain GPIO wakeup (`gpio_wakeup_enable` + `esp_sleep_enable_gpio_wakeup`), which works on any digital pin — not just RTC-capable ones. As a bonus, light sleep keeps RAM intact, so the board resumes on the exact face it was showing instead of rebooting back to "normal".

### 3. Board turns off while holding the button, then immediately turns back on while still holding it
**Cause:** The GPIO wakeup used here is level-triggered (`GPIO_INTR_LOW_LEVEL`) — it wakes as soon as the pin *reads* LOW. If you enter sleep while your finger is still holding the button down, the pin is already LOW, so it wakes up instantly, before you've even let go.
**Fix:** Wait for the button to be **released** before actually calling `esp_light_sleep_start()`:
```cpp
while (digitalRead(BOOT_BUTTON) == LOW) delay(10);  // wait for release first
delay(50);                                          // debounce
// ...then actually go to sleep
```
With this in place, the real sequence is: hold ~1s → **release** → it sleeps → tap again → it wakes.

### 4. OLED shows nothing at all (blank screen, nothing crashes)
**Likely causes, in order of likelihood:**
- Wrong I2C address. This code assumes `0x3C`; some clone boards use `0x3D`. Run a basic I2C scanner sketch to confirm.
- SDA/SCL swapped, or on the wrong pins. Double check against the [wiring](#wiring) table above.
- OLED powered from 5V instead of 3V3 — some modules survive this, some don't display correctly, some are damaged over time. Always use 3V3 unless the module explicitly says 5V-tolerant.

### 5. `softAP() returned: false` in Serial Monitor
**Cause:** Usually the same TX-power brownout issue as #1, just caught before the AP even reports success. Occasionally caused by a `password` shorter than 8 characters — WiFi requires 8+ characters for WPA2, or an empty string `""` for a fully open network.

### 6. Buttons on the web page don't seem to do anything
**Cause:** Usually the phone is still connected to the board's AP but the animation is mid-frame, or the phone silently reconnected to your home WiFi instead of staying on "RobotEyes" (some phones do this automatically since the AP has no internet access).
**Fix:** Check your phone is still showing "RobotEyes" as the active WiFi network, not just in range. Some phones have a setting like "stay connected to network with no internet" that needs to be toggled on for the AP to be picked and held.

---

## How it works (short version)

- On boot, the ESP32 creates its own WiFi access point (no router needed) and starts a tiny web server on port 80.
- Visiting `http://192.168.4.1` in a phone browser loads a page (`handleRoot()`) with buttons.
- Each button tap calls `/set?mode=...` (`handleSet()`), which updates a `currentMode` variable.
- The main `loop()` continuously redraws the OLED based on whatever `currentMode` currently is, and checks the BOOT button on every pass so it stays responsive even mid-animation.
- Holding BOOT long enough puts the chip into light sleep (screen + WiFi off); a later tap wakes it back up and restarts the access point.
